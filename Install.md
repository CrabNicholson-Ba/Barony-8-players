Steps to install: 

1: Download the Barony_8P.rar from the releases

2: Copy your Barony game from your Steam files and place the game in a new folder.

3: Place the folders and the Barony_MP.exe from the .rar in that folder.

4: Launch click "Play Game" and Online or Lan depending on what you're doing

5: Make sure there are arrows on the character sheet lineup.

Important: Do not click "Play Modded Game"; nothing happens.

A tip: The mod has most likely worked if the Seed Events tab does not appear.
